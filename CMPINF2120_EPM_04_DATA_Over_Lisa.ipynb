    "Educational Process Mining (EPM): A Learning Analytics Data Set. (2015). UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational Process Mining data set consists of student activity and outcome data for an e-learning simulation course in digital electronics. The experiments were carried out with a group of 115 first-year, undergraduate Engineering major students of the University of Genoa. The simulation environment, called Deeds (Digital Electronics Education and Design Suite), provides learning materials through specialized browsers and asks students to solve various problems with different levels of difficulty. For more information about the Deeds simulator see http://www.esng.dibe.unige.it/deeds/.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this application because I wanted to work with student-level education data. This dataset contains exercise and activity inputs and interim and final grade outcome data. It is likely that my research for the LIS PhD program would also involve student-level data. My goal for this project is to learn how to visulaize and analyze this kind of data, which is time series where each input record has a start and end time and represents the amount of time the student spent on the recorded exercise and activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have worked with education data in the past, but it was school-level aggregated data: School Performance Profile scores. I have domain knowledge (graduate coursework in Education and a PA state teaching certificate). I have not researched how to work with this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the data provided with this project is sufficient to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What factors influence student outcomes for this course?\n",
    "* Is there a linear relationship between the total time spent and/or the number of sessions/exercises/activities completed and student outcomes? \n",
    "* Can student outcomes be predicted from time spent and/or the number of sessions/exercises/activities completed?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reads in all data, evaluates variables, creates new input variables, renames variables to simply exploration and modeling, and outputs the data to CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 session folders with student input data and two excel files with intermediate and final grades. Each session folder contains separate data sets for each student who participated in that session, either partially or fully. Each student data file contains fields for the session and student ID so each of these files were read in and concatenated to form one inputs data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 13 columns and 227129 rows in the concatenated input data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Four ID columns as type integer - `session` and `student_id`\n",
    "* Four object columns, two should be dates - `exercise`, `activity`, `start_time`, and `end_time`\n",
    "* Seven integer columns - `idle_time`, `mouse_wheel`, `mouse_wheel_click`, `mouse_click_left`, `mouse_click_right`, `mouse_movement`, and `keystoke`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 columns and 115 rows in the intermediate grades data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One ID column as type integer - `Student Id`\n",
    "* Five float columns for sessions 2 through 6 intermediate grades\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 18 columns and 62 rows in the final grades data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One ID column as type interger - `Student ID`\n",
    "* Seventeen float columns - 16 for the individual test question values and one for the total score \n",
    "\n",
    "There are no missing data in the input, intermediate grades, or final grades data. However, not all students participated in all sessions, exercises, activities, and final assessment so records do not exist in these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new input variables include\n",
    "\n",
    "* `total_ms` is the difference in milliseconds between `start_time` and `end_time`.\n",
    "* `activity_group` is the activity name, the first portion of the activity variable value, which consists of an activity and an associated exercise. Activities are 'Other', 'Aulaweb', 'Blank', 'Deeds', 'Study', 'Properties','Diagram', 'TextEditor', 'Study_Materials', 'Fsm_Related', 'FSM'\n",
    "* `activity_exercise` is the exercise portion of the activity variable value.\n",
